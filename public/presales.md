Selling services - ppl skills, project realisation.

New customers are very difficult - 10% success chance.

Existing customers - new projet or a new phase in an existing project (well done projects often spawn new requests).

A good measure of project success is having followup phases

Project types:
- outsorcing: responsible for the whole delivery
- insourcing: work together with the customer
- bodyleasing: customer needs people to work with him

commando project

Budget types:
- T&M
    - invoiced
    - end of month
    - CVs are crucial for proposals
    - risk on the client side 
    - the least amount of paperwork
- Royalties
    - vendor gets paid a percentage for each installation, product sold etc.
- License
- Flat fee
    - fixed monthly rate
    - usually for support
- Fixed price (Metsa)
    - risk on vendor side
    - can be mitigated by including a financial buffer within the price (but retaining competitiveness)
    - vendor can execute the project in any way he wants
    - payments per milestone (e.g. 25%), at the end of the project etc.
    - finishing early and with less resources is a bonus for the vendor
    - going over the deadline incurs penalties: try to mitigate this, build partner relationships and be transparent
- mixed...
    - any combination of the above
    - e.g. royalties with a flat base
    - e.g. T&M with an upper limit

A common approach is FP -> TM (when trust is built).

==Terminology==

RFQ - request for quote
RFP - request for proposal
Ballpark - guesstimate

Proposal structure

- exec. summary
- requirements
- competences summary: why us
- approach: 
    - components, modules and their functionalities
    - phases e.g. P1: workshops, PoC, productization
    - what we thought about
    - scope
    - architecture
    - design
    - etc.
- estimates
    - break the scope down into as small as possible chunks
    - take into acct as many possibilities as you can
- timeline
- team
    - short bios
- references
    - previous projects

Pre-sales support

Understanding what needs to be done and convincing the customer about being the right partner.

- workshops, meetings to get more details
    - phone, onsite etc.
- determining the scope
    - requirement analysis
    - pull it oout of a client
- estimates, ballparks
- resourcing matches
    - right people for the right jobs

The mentioned things are the baseline, required stuff.

Client approach strategy:
Trying to convince the client ot do the correct thing or implement anything he wants without asking:
-workshops, meetings to find some middle ground.

Adding value to a proposal:

- prototypes
    - sometimes even when a client does not ask for them
- UX designs
- feasibility study
- architecture 
    - what goes where: mobile, backend, web etc.
- tehnology suggestion & research
- propose approach
    - fix errors in client's thinking to allow them achieve better results
    - strategic projects are sometimes worth keeping your mouth shut: e.g. high prestige projects or ones serving as a gateway to other projects.

Clients love when they can touch something i.e. a prototype - it makes it more real for them and also us look more invested and competent.

In some areas, paid proposals are a standard practice:
- more "waterfally"
- helping the client specify what they really want
- designs/prototypes are also a part of this
- everything within the proposal is geared towards the current offer

Look for proposals on yammer/email/flowdock - some have been shared.

How to smuggle quality into a project:
- sales work: educate the client
- estimate everything (QA, PM, travels etc.) not only development
- bear the QA cost yourself

Ending notes
- customers are the most important part of the company
- sales and pre-sales have usually the highest priority
- time is of the essence - RFP hase a short timespan
- being transparent and honest about risks usually pays off
- it's our job to understand what the customer needs (not wants)
- remember the business aspects of the customer need - the projects have to contribute to the client's business
- estimate everything (QA, PM, travels etc.) not only development
- think about enablers, not blockers
- put effort into making the offer competitive (see "adding value to a proposal")
    - e.g. use a framework that will make it cheaper and being cheaper in result, increasing the chances of winning


Prospecting:
- salesmen ahve large networks, from which they can pick clients
- ther ecan be RFQ or an RFP or you need to know somebody to be aware that a need is arising
