Querying
GET/PUT/DELETE
MapReduce
Full-Text Search
Secondary Indexes (2i)

Client libraries for nearly every platform.

Under the hood
consistent hashing
160bit keyspace

replicas
requests go to fallback neighboring nodes when a node fails
handoff - data returns when node is back up

and rebalancing

masterless, deployed as a cluster of 5 nodes per cluster

automatic self healing
repairs divergent, missing or corrupt replicas
large clusters, long term storage


Riak 1.4
Eventually consistent counters
- distributed data type in Riak
- PN Counters are capable of being incremented (P) an decremeted (N)
- automatic conflict resolution after a network partition
- 2i queries are sorted and client can request only first N results
- pagination allows queries to begin where n left off to deliver the rest
- can also view start, continuation, end value etc.

Riak Control - mgmt studio?

progressbar for handoff
reduced object storage overhead (not turned on by default- check release notes)
udpated protocol buffer properties
overload protection for vnode processes
cascading real-time writes for riak enterprise multi-datacenter replication


when and why?
enough data to require >1 physical machine (>5 prefereably)
when availability > consistency (big data, critical data)
when data can be modeled as keys and values - denormalization

Case studies
enstratatius - cloud infrastructure mgmt
George Reese - moving from mysql to riak
best buy - replatform of e-commerce platform
copious - registered accts and tokens for FB/twitter logins; lookign to move over more data due to operational simplicity.
mochi - high availability and low latency
openX - couchDB + cassandra -> riak and riak core
voxer - 60 nodes, 100s TBs of data, 400k concurrent users, billions of daily requests

Hybrid solutions
- riak with postgres
- riak with elastic search
- riak with hadoop
- secondary analytic clusters (enterprise)

Hosting options
- amazon AMIs
- Engine Yard
- Azure VM depot
- SoftLayer

Open Source + commercial (enterprise)
- multi datacenter replication
- realtime or full-sync
- 24/7 support
1.4 enterprise
- faster, more conns bvetween clusters
- per connection statistics - better
- ssl, nat and full sync scheduling support

Riak Cloud Storage
- large object support
- S3-compatible API
-multi-tenancy
- reporting on usage

Future Work
- tight Solr integration
- greater consistency
-faster data transfer between clusters
- dynamic ring resizing
- check github
