= Scala - traits =

Instead of abstract class one also often uses the keyword `trait` in Scala.
Traits are abstract classes that are meant to be added to some other class.
This might be because a trait adds some methods or fields to an unknown parent
class.
For instance, a trait Bordered might be used to add a border to a various
graphical components.
Another usage scenario is where the trait collects signatures of some 
functionality provided by different classes, much in the way a Java interface 
would work.
