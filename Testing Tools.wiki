= Mailcatcher =

MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it
to display in a web interface. Run mailcatcher, set your favourite app to
deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check
out http://127.0.0.1:1080 to see the mail that's arrived so far.

_This is not strictly a testing tool but it has a good potential of testing
e-mail based functionalities._
