= Quality sleep =

Not getting enough sleep negatively affects energy, positvity, productivity
and memory.
Especially in the long run.
The key to avoid daytime sleepiness is to maintain _sleep hygiene_.

The following steps might help:

- *Cut back on computer after 8 p.m.*
    - The bright light emitted from screens suppresses melatonin production.
    - Turn electronic devices off at least an hour or two before going to bed.
- *Hide your alarm clock.*
    - Do not watch the clock to see how long does it take you to fall asleep.
    - Do not check the clock to see how long you have left until you need to get up.
    - Such hypervigilance keeps the brain awake.
- *Make your room comfortably cool.*
    - 12 to 24 degrees is considered _comfortable_.
- *Don't drink before sleep.*
    - Alcohol helps you fall asleep but reduces sleep quality.
- *Get your exercise.*
    - Exercising helps you to spend more time in deep sleep.
- *Follow the 15 minute rule.*
    - If you can't fall asleep (or can't go back to sleep) after 15 minutes, stop trying.
    - Get out of bed, do someting relaxing that will help to clear your head.
        - Reading, meditating, knitting (...)
        - But do NOT use the computer.
    - Go back to bed once you're sleepy again.
- *Write down stressors.*
    - Do some mental problem-solving before sleeping.
    - Also, you can do it while commuting or showering in the morning.
    - Having the mere sense that you have established a plan for tackling your todos will help you be calm.
