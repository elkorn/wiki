The connection between polymorphic set comprehension notation and the `for` notation in Scala can be made explicit by stating the following relationship:
    The correspondence between set comprehension and `for` notation takes $\{*|pattern \in S | condition |*\}$ to:
    #+begin_example
    for (x <- S if condition) yield {
        x match { case pattern => x }
    }
    #+end_example
