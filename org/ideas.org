** Notes

Re-implement the seedling of this project that you've made a few years back.

- Walk the links on the simple HTML GMail interface.
- Use the GMail search queries for enhanced flexibility.
- Display as simple and efficient an interface as possible.
- Stick to basic elements - rely on Vimium / Vimperator to achieve maximum usage comfort. 
- Use user-defined labels.
- Allow predefining criteria.
- Use a persistence mechanism.
