* P=NP
#= P=NP =

The general class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in
polynomial time is called $P$.

For some questions there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but given a
ready-made answer, it may be possible to verify its correctness quickly.

The class of questions for which an answer can be _verified_ in polynomial time
is called $NP$.

$P=NP$ is really a question. If it was true, it would mean that problems
verifiable in polynomial time would also be solvable in polynomial time.
If $P
eq NP$ was true, it would mean that there exist problems answers for
which can be verified in polynomial time, but they cannot be solved as fast.
