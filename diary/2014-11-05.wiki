= Being the worst - ep. 11/12 (Application and Domain Services, DSL-based code generation) =

Notion of context maps

DSL helper is used to generate e.g. message contract classes.

Application service is a class running inside a server.
It accepts incoming commands - syntax is similar to event handling.
Within the implementations of application services, their methods call the aggregates.
An application server manages aggregate lifetime and sreves mainly as a communication layer between incoming commands and the aggregate API.
Additional dependencies are also passed through the application services' constructors.

Interesting concept - using Git concepts in distributed data domain.
The data would be merged, rebased from master etc.

Double dispatch - e.g. make a method producing a car generic.
Its `apply` method creates a `CarProduced` event 

*I need to download the code exapmles, the topics are getting dense and case-specific.*
